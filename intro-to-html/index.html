<h2>About me</h2>
<img src="img.jpg" alt="A photo of me"> 
<p>I'm a student at Algonquin college, I've been in Canada for over a year now. Despite it being a completly different lifestyle for me, I managed to get used to the change and most importantly the weather. Winter just went by and I can remember waking up every morning while it's -30 degrees outside to go to work, I would find my car frozen to a point where it can barely start. </p>

 <p>I consider myself a pretty chill person, I get along with people quite well. However, In the past, I had some issues with my social skills, I was a bit autistic, not being able to make any eye contact or have a calm conversation with strangers. That's one of many perks Canada offered me, it helped me develop my personal and mental abilities. I love it here! It's such a beautiful place! I heard a fun quote once about Canada:</p>

   <p><strong><blockquote>"Canada has two main seasons, winter and construction".</blockquote>
    </strong></p>
    <p>Which I definitely agree with, haha!.</p>
